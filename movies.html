    <h1>The best movies I have ever seen</h1>
    <h2>Top 3</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fight Club (1999)</h3>
    <p>Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helene Bonham Carter, is a movie about an insomniac office worker and a very reckless soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into much more. I fell in love the first time I watched this movie, and I'm a huge fan of the themes covered in this movie, like the exploration of the self, identities, sexuality, and of course, a deep hatred for capitalism and domestic terrorism.</p>
    <h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)</h3>
    <p>This Oscar winning animated film by Sony revolves around teenager Miles Morales, who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and must dawn the mask of the famed superhero to save the world! This movie holds a very special place in my heart. In one of my darkest, most scariest and confusing moments of my life, I watched this movie and realized just how silly I was being. My lack of sleep and constant stress from the societal pressures caused me to experience insane levels of anxiety, and I realized that the expectations set upon me by others shouldn't pressure me, but help me become the person I want to be.</p>
    <h3>Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)</h3>
    <p>The Dragon Warrior must face his past, as Prince Shen returns to his home, ready to conquer all of China. I'm not even kidding when I say this is literally the best animated movie sequel. It is the perfect mix of comedy, action and heartfelt drama. I burst out laughing at any joke, I weep like a widow at any emotional moment, I stare in awe with my jaw on the floor at any perfectly paced action scene. 10/10!!!</p>
